        NASA is trying to send another rover to Mars, but instead of sending one super expensive rover, they want to send a swarm of cheaper ones to cooperate with each other and gather resources. That's where we come in!<br><br>
        
        The NASA Swarmathon competition was designed to engage students in developing cooperative robotic algorithms that simulate gathering and storing resources in space.<br><br>
        
        My job as project lead was to select a team of software, electrical, and mechanical engineers to work together to create, test, and document algorithms for three robots to gather as many resources as possible within an hour and return them to a home base.<br><br>

                <br><br>I hosted workshops in both C++ and Python, which were the primary languages used with the Robot Operating System(ROS). Everything was created using ROS and with Linux Ubuntu.<br><br>
                
                As a team, we developed what we called the "Pizza Search" algorithm, which had each rover start at home base, go off in a straight line, turn in a semi-circle, then return to home base if it finds a resource. The name was inspired by various overnight sessions that involved every college student's favorite late-night brain snack: pizza.

                <br><br>One of the most rewarding aspects of this project as Project Lead was participating in the outreach program. I would host weekly classes at a local classroom on robotics and software development. The best part was seeing these kids excited about engineering, overall.<br><br>
                
                Most of the weeks we would focus on the NASA Swarmathon High School competition but most of the time we would find ways to programmatically break the software and try to figure out what when wrong. The best part was making a rover do donuts and having these students figure out what went wrong.
